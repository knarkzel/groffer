# Header

This is a paragraph. It has **bold** text.
Also has *italics*. Here comes my new list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

* Item 4
* Item 5
* Item 6

For another example, here's ordered list:

0. I am a list with number 1
1. I am a list with number 2
4. I am a list with number 3
3. I am a list with number 4

0) I am a list with number 5
1) I am a list with number 6
4) I am a list with number 7
3) I am a list with number 8

Here comes the source code:

```rust
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```
